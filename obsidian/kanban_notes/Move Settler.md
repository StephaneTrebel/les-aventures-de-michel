## Can be selected

- Ability to select a tile by raycasting on the Z-axis (z-index) to actually find "what" is selected
- If it's the Settler unit, display other "target selectors" (displayed with another color) to indicate possible tiles to go to:
 \[ \] \[ \] \[ \]
 \[ \] \[S\] \[ \]
 \[ \] \[ \] \[ \]

## Can be moved

- When the "target selectors" are displayed, clicking on one of them move the Settler to the target tile


## Not now (maybe later)

- If clicked outside of these selectors, clear the selection
